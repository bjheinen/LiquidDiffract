## Requirements

* [Python >= 3.5](https://www.python.org)
* [SciPy >= 1.2.1](https://www.scipy.org)
* [NumPy >= 1.16.2](https://numpy.org)
* [PyQt5 >= 5.12](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro)
* [pyqtgraph >= 0.10.0](http://www.pyqtgraph.org)
* [importlib_resources](https://pypi.org/project/importlib_resources/) is required if using Python<3.7

LiquidDiffract should run with earlier versions of these python packages but is untested.
LiquidDiffract is system-independent and has been tested on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
Dependencies are handled automatically when installing with *pip*.

## Installation

The simplest way to install LiquidDiffract is directly from PyPI with pip:

```$ pip install LiquidDiffract```

The source code is directly available [here](https://github.com/bjheinen/LiquidDiffract/archive/master.zip)

We still recommend pip for installing from a local directory.
*(Invoke setup.py directly at your own risk!)*

<details><summary><b>Development installation</b></summary>

You can make a development (editable) install by using pip's *-e* flag:

```$ pip install -e git+https://github.com/bjheinen/LiquidDiffract#egg=LiquidDiffract```

From a local directory:

```
$ cd /path/to/local/directory/
$ curl -Lo LiquidDiffract.zip https://github.com/bjheinen/LiquidDiffract/archive/master.zip
$ unzip LiquidDiffract.zip 
$ mv LiquidDiffract-*/ LiquidDiffract/
$ pip install -e /path/to/local/directory/LiquidDiffract/
```

This will not actually install anything, but create an .egg-link file in the deployment directory that links to LiquidDiffract's source code.

It is useful if you want to make changes to the source code without having to re-install. Use Python's site-packages directory as the deployment directory if you want your editable install of LiquidDiffract available on your sys.path for other programs using your Python installation. To do this from the github page use the *-t* flag ```-t /path/to/directory```

</details>

## Usage

### Loading the GUI

To run the software use the command

```$ LiquidDiffract```

or run *'LiquidDiffract.py'* from the installation directory ```$ python LiquidDiffract.py```

### Basic Usage

There are four main tabs which provide a selection of toolboxes for data operations at different stages of the workflow.

* Background scaling/subtraction
* Data operations: structure factor calculation, interference function optimisation, and density refinement
* PDF calculation and data output
* Estimation of coordination numbers and bond lengths (integration and curve-fitting)

Data are automatically plotted and tabs updated as operations are made. The graphical plots display coordinates in the upper-right corner. Click and drag or use the scroll-wheel to zoom in on a region. Double right-click to reset the view.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjheinen/LiquidDiffract/master/LiquidDiffract/resources/docs/LiquidDiffract v1.1.6-dev_refinement_tab.png"></p>


### Background Subtraction Tab

This tab allows data and (optionally) background files to be loaded in. The auto-scale feature speeds up workflow but is not recommended for a close fit. 

All data must be in Q-space. A toolbox is provided to convert raw experimental data of 2&theta; values to Q-space. By default LiquidDiffract expects data in inverse Angstroms, but an option to change this to inverse nano-metres is available in the *Additional Preferences* dialog, which is accessible from the *Tools* menu.


### Refinement Tab

This is the tab where most of the data processing takes place.

The sample composition can be set here, along with data processing options. After setting these options the interference function *i(Q)* is calculated and displayed. i(Q) is related to the total molecular structure factor as: 

<img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i(Q)=S(Q)-1\;\;\;\text{or}\;\;\;i(Q)=S(Q)-S_{\infty}'/> 

depending on the formalism used. 

This function can then be normalised by minimising errors in the real-space 'differential correlation function', *D(r)*:

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?D(r)=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{Q_\mathrm{{Max}}}Qi(Q)\sin(Qr)dq'/>

In *LiquidDiffract* the integral in the function *D(r)* is calculated by taking the imaginary portion of the inverse Fourier transform of *Qi(Q)* using a standard FFT algorithm.


#### Composition Toolbox

The sample composition must be set before the structure factor, *S(Q)*, can be calculated. The sample density (in atoms per cubic angstroms) should also be set here. If the density is to be refined, this is used as the initial value passed to the solver.

#### Data Options

Spurious peaks or oscillations (e.g. from a slightly mislocated beam stop) in the low-*Q* region can be removed by setting a *Q*-min cut-off.

At high Q-values experimental data often becomes increasingly noisy because the relative contribution of coherent scattering to the experimental signal decreases. This increasingly noisy signal can lead to anomalous oscillations near the first peak in *D(r)*. It can therefore be beneficial to truncate the data at high-*Q*. However truncation can cause spurious peaks in *D(r)* as a result of the Fourier transform. The positions of these peaks are a function of Q-max, so the use of different values should be investigated. Discussion on the effect of Q-max can be found in ref. [1] and [5].

The option to smooth the data will apply a Savitzky-Golay filter to the data. Options to change the length of the filter window and the order of the polynomial used to fit samples can be found in the *Additional Preferences* dialog, accessible from the *Tools* menu.

LiquidDiffract provides the option to use either Ashcroft-Langreth [6] or Faber-Ziman [7] formalisms of the structure factor. See Keen et al., 2001 [8] for discussions of differences in structure factor formalisms, or the LiquidDiffract source code for specific implementations. 

In both formalisms the total molecular structure factor, *S(Q)*, is converted to normalised units using the method of Krogh-Moe [9] and Norman [10].

Applying a modification function to *S(Q)* before FFT can help suppress truncation ripples and can correct a gradient in the high-Q region. Two functions are currently implemented:

**Lorch [13]:**

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?M\left(Q\right)=\frac{\sin\left(\tfrac{\pi%20Q}{Q_{max}}\right)}{\left(\tfrac{\pi%20Q}{Q_{max}}\right)}'/>


**Cosine Window (Drewitt et al.) [14]:**

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?M\left(Q\right)%20=\begin{cases}1&if\;\,Q%3CQ_{window\_start}\\0.5\left[1+\cos\left(\frac{x\pi}{N-1}\right)\right]&if\;\,Q_{window\_start}%3CQ\leq%20Q_{max}\\0&if\;\,Q%3EQ_{max}\end{cases}'/>
>
>where N is width of the window function
>and x is an integer with values from 0 : (N-1) across the window

After calculating the structure factor the final tab can be used to output *S(Q)*, the pair distribution function, *g(r)*, and the radial distribution function, *RDF(r)*, as is.


#### Iterative Structure Factor Refinement

The numerical iterative procedure used by LiquidDiffract to minimize the error in the determination of *g(r)* follows the one proposed by Eggert et al., 2002 [1-4]. This procedure is based on the assumption that a minimum distance, r-min, can be defined, which represents the largest distance (0 -- r-min) where no atom can be found. In a liquid, this should be the region within the 1st coordination shell. Because no atom can be present in this region, no oscillations should be observed in the *g(r)* function. As a result, the function *D(r < r-min)* = -4&pi;r&rho; However oscillations are commonly observed in this region, due to the effect of an experimentally limited *Q*-range (*Q*-max < &inf;), and systematic errors in the scattering factors and normalisation factor, &alpha;. The iterative procedure calculates the difference between real and model data in the low-*r* region and scales *S(Q)* accordingly to reduce this.

To refine *S(Q)* the value of *r*-min should be set carefully, as it has a strong influence. The position of *r*-min should correspond to the base of the first coordinence sphere in the *g(r)*.

The number of iterations in the procedure can also be set; a minimum of 3 is normally required for convergence.

A *&Chi;<sup>2</sup>* figure of merit, defined as the area under the curve *&Delta;D(r) for r<r-min*, is used to rate the refinement.

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\chi^{2}_{\left(n\right)}(\rho)=\int_{0}^{r_{min}}\left[\Delta{D}_{(n)}(r)\right]^2dr'/>

Where,

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Delta{D}_{(n)}(r)= D_{(n)}(r)-\left(-4\pi\rho{r}\right),\;for\;r<r_{min}'/>

#### Density (&rho;) Refinement

The sample density can be determined by finding the value of &rho; that provides the best convergence of the iterative procedure described above. This is done by minimising the resultant value of *&Chi;<sup>2</sup>*. LiquidDiffract supports several different solvers to do this. The solver in use, along with specific options like convergence criteria and number of iterations, can be selected from the *Additional Preferences* dialog. The solvers currently supported are:

* L-BFGS-B [16-17]

* SLSQP [18]

* COBYLA [19-21]

All solvers require upper and lower bounds on the density to be set.

For more information on these optimisation algorithms please see the [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html), or consult the references listed.

##### Global optimisation capability

The optimisation algorithms used to estimate density work best when the initial guess, &rho;<sub>0</sub> is close to the true value. If the density of the material is very poorly known it is recommended to use the global optimisation option provided. It is not recommended if a good initial guess can be made, due to slower, and sometimes poor, convergence.

The global optimisation procedure used is the basin-hopping algorithm provided by the SciPy library [22-23]. Basin-hopping is a stochastic algorithm which attempts to find the global minimum of a function by applying an iterative process with each cycle composed of the following features:

1. random perturbation of the coordinates
2. local minimization
3. accept or reject the new coordinates based on the minimized function value

The acceptance test used here is the Metropolis criterion of standard Monte Carlo algorithms [23].

For more information see the [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.basinhopping.html), or consult the references listed.


#### Note on Number of Iterations in the Eggert Procedure & *&Chi;<sup>2</sup>* Minimisation

It is important to note that a well defined minimum in *&Chi;<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>* only exists for n <~ 10. This is a result of how the iterative procedure works, and the definition of *&Chi;<sup>2</sup>*.

<details><summary><b>More info...</b></summary>

The Eggert method works by forcing the region below r<sub>min</sub> to fit a line defined as -4&pi;&rho;r. *&Chi;<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>* is the square of the area between this modelled line and *D(r) (r < r<sub>min</sub>)* after *n* iterations. *&Chi;<sup>2</sup>(&rho;)* should display a minimum when the slope (controlled by density) best fits the data. However, after a large number of iterations the data can always be forced to fit the model slope through unreasonable manipulation (e.g. by massively inflating low-Q values), and so *&Chi;<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>* will be drastically reduced at large values of *n*. Furthermore, at large values of *n*, *&Chi;<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>* will decrease as *&rho;* --> 0, because the absolute values used to calculate *&Chi;<sup>2</sup>* are smaller as the magnitude of the slope decreases.

We can investigate this by computing the function *&Chi;<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>(&rho;, n)* - in this case for an example composition with a density ~0.048 atoms per cubic Angstrom. Plotting *&Chi;<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>(&rho;)* for *n = 4* and *n = 25* shows that with only 25 iterations there is no longer a well defined minimum.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjheinen/LiquidDiffract/master/LiquidDiffract/resources/docs/4_and_25_iterations.png"></p>

As *n* increases, the density region in which the eggert algorithm can fit the data to the model is rapidly increasing too:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjheinen/LiquidDiffract/master/LiquidDiffract/resources/docs/fitting_region.png"></p>

The range of value of *n* that result in a well defined minimum will depend on the data (or more properly on the r<sub>min</sub> value used). This change in the behaviour of *&Chi;<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>(&rho;, n)* can best be illustrated by plotting the double natural logarithm of normalised *&Chi;<sup>2</sup>* values, because the magnitude of *&Chi;<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>(&rho;, n)* is so much lower at large *n*, and the minima in the function much shallower. For this data it takes 3 iterations for the procedure to converge properly, after which there is a clear stable minimum which allows an accurate density estimate to be retrieved. Above 10 iterations the method no longer works, because of a sharp shelf in the function.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjheinen/LiquidDiffract/master/LiquidDiffract/resources/docs/chi_squared_minimum_map.png"></p>

At high enough resolution the number of iterations can be optimised. For this particular data it is 7.

#### Terminal & Log-file Output

A log is automatically generated for any refinement made. This log includes information on the data file, sample composition, data and refinement options used, solver output/convergence info (if refining density), and the final *&Chi;<sup>2</sup>* and *&rho;*.

The log for each refinement is automatically written to file. The default behaviour is to store each log in a file named 'refinement.log' within the current data directory. Each log is preceded by a time-stamp. The log-mode can be changed to *Overwrite* in the *Additional Preferences* dialog. This creates a new log file for each data file loaded, which will be overwritten if already present. The file-names generated are of the form 'DATAFILENAME_refinement.log' and are similarly created in the source directory of the loaded data file.

LiquidDiffract outputs some density refinement information to the terminal. There is an option provided to print convergence progress messages to the terminal also. This can be useful for real-time monitoring (e.g. when using the slow global optimisation with a known number of iterations).

### PDF Calculation (Output) Tab

The third tab displays the optimised S(Q), g(r), and RDF(r). The buttons at the bottom of the window allow each one to be saved to a text file. If a modification function has been used in the data treatment then information on this will also be saved, along with the raw S(Q).

*g(r)* is the *pair-distribution function*. It is defined as:

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?g(r)-1=\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}r\rho_{0}}\int_{0}^{Q_{Max}}Qi(Q)\sin(Qr)dq'/>

Where the interference function, i(Q) is:

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i(Q)=S(Q)-S_{\infty}'/>


RDF(r) is the radial distribution function:

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?RDF(r)=4\pi{r}^2\rho_{0}g(r)=\left({\frac{2r}{\pi}\int_{0}^{Q_{Max}}Qi(Q)\sin(Qr)dq}\right)+4\pi{r}^2\rho_{0}'/>

its integration across peaks yields atomic coordination numbers.

<details><summary><b><i>D(r)</i></b></summary>

The density function, *D(r)*, that is used in the data analysis and defined [above](#refinement-tab), should not be confused with *g(r)* or *RDF(r)*. In the literature it is sometimes referred to by other names, including *F(r)*, *G(r)*, and *PDF(r)*. It is defined as:

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?D(r)=G(r)=F(r)=PDF(r)=4\pi{r}\left[\rho(r)-\rho_0\right]=4\pi{r}\rho_{0}\left[g(r)-1\right]'/>

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?D(r)=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{Q_{Max}}Qi(Q)\sin(Qr)dq'/>

</details>

### Structural Information Tab

This tab provides tools to extract coordination numbers and average bond lengths from the *RDF(r)*. Two toolboxes are provided, an integration toolbox which does simple integration across peaks in the *RDF(r)* for monatomic samples, and a curve-fitting toolbox which allows the user to fit the *RDF(r)* with an arbitrary number of weighted gaussian-type peaks. 

#### Integration Toolbox

Integrating across the peaks in *RDF(r)* gives the average coordination number. Three methods for doing this are provided based on those commonly used in the literature [24]. The first method is based on the assumption that the quantity *rg(r)* is symmetrical for a coordination shell about its average position. The second method is based on the assumption that the coordination shell is instead symmetrical about a radius which defines the maximum in the *r<sup>2</sup>g(r)* curve. Since the first peak is not truly symmetrical *N<sub>A</sub>* and *N<sub>B</sub>* can be considered estimates of the lower bound on the coordination number. Typically it also the case that *N<sub>A</sub> < N<sub>B</sub>*. This consideration of asymmetry leads to the third method, which involves integrating *RDF(r)* from the leading edge of the first peak *r<sub>0</sub>* to first minimum following it, *r<sub>min</sub>*.

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\bar{N}_{A}=2\int^{r%27_{\rm{max}}}_{r%27_{0}}4\pi\rho_{0}r\left[rg(r)\right]_{\rm{sym}}dr'/>

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\bar{N}_{B}=2\int^{r_{\rm{max}}}_{r_{0}}4\pi\rho_{0}\left[r^2g(r)\right]_{\rm{sym}}dr'/>

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\bar{N}_{C}=\int^{r_{\rm{min}}}_{r_{0}}4\pi\rho_{0}r^2g(r)dr'/>

An auto-refine button is provided to quickly find the positions of *r<sub>0</sub>*, *r'<sub>max</sub>*, *r<sub>max</sub>* and *r<sub>min</sub>* using a root-finding and minimisation procedure. The user can also set the limits manually via a spinbox or by dragging the limits on the data plot. In particular, careful setting of *r<sub>min</sub>* may be required as its apparent value can fluctuate due to errors in *RDF(r)* [25].

#### Curve Fitting Toolbox

For polyatomic samples it is more useful to fit the *RDF(r)* with a number of peaks so that the individual contribution from different *&alpha;-&beta;* pairs can be investigated [26-27]. LiquidDiffract provides a curve fitting toolbox to do this. Either the *RDF(r)* or the *T(r)* can be fitted, with *T(r)* defined as:

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?T(r)=\frac{RDF(r)}{r}'/>

LiquidDiffract fits the data with an arbitrary number of gaussian type peaks (with an optional skewness parameter) based on the function:

><img src='http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?T(r)=\sum_{\alpha\beta}\left[\frac{\bar{N}_{\alpha\beta}W^{%27\rm{x-ray}}_{\alpha\beta}}{c_{\beta}\sigma_{\alpha\beta}r\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(r-r_{\alpha\beta}\right)^2}{2\sigma_{\alpha\beta}^2}\right]\times\left[1+\text{erf}\left(\xi\frac{r-r_{\alpha\beta}}{\sigma_{\alpha\beta}\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]\right]'/>

The x-ray weighting factors are computed automatically and the fitting parameters are the coordination number, *N<sub>&alpha;&beta;</sub>*, the bond length, *r<sub>&alpha;&beta;</sub>*, and a measure of the bond length distribution, *&sigma;<sub>&alpha;&beta;</sub>*. The skewness parameter, *&xi;*, is optional in the fit. All of the parameters can be set manually and individually toggled between remaining fixed or allowed to vary in the fit.


### Using LiquidDiffract Core Library

The module LiquidDiffract.core.core is the core library which provides all the specific functions for processing (liquid) diffraction data. This can be imported and used in your own Python code. There are also some data helper functions (e.g. to rebin data) found in LiquidDiffract.core.data_utils

A brief example of using LiquidDiffract in a custom data processing script is given below:
