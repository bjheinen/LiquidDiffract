Polyatomic case works?
>> work through eggert and double check all the stages


Compute error on the density refinement?
> can get estimate from the inverse hessian (i.e. > how sharp the minimum in the function is)


check other methods of doing this



Work through faber-ziman - try other paper to see what goes on


add legends to plots >> refined one is dashed line!
change color or S(Q)*M(Q)


On save out files >> add info about refined density used for measurement
change name to whatver going for etc.





add options for data smoothing
window length & poly order



when composition deleted, clear plots
when new data file loaded, clear data from other uis as well
