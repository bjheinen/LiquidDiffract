LiquidDiffract
==============

LiquidDiffract is a GUI application for treating experimental X-ray diffraction data of liquid structures. 
LiquidDiffract can perform background subtraction, fourier transformation, data (quantitative structure factor) optimisation/normalisation, and estimation of density. 
The sub-package LiquidDiffract.core provides useful functions for common numerical operations on such diffraction data.

Core functions available from

    >>> import LiquidDiffract.core.core

Additional utilities from

    >>> import LiquidDiffract.core.data_manip


Please see the documentation on the LiquidDiffract homepage for more details.
