In results UI save output > also add S_inf info for AL only, if statement to check method




Then README file

--- should make it rich text so can see equations???

- structure of package etc. where all the files are
reference list - including for included data!!! - ask james where this from


Then use of core program

>> code example of how to set parameters, etc.


Then walkthrough of actual gui, subtracting backgrounds, etc. etc.

--------

in core:

test negative DELTA F(r) causes

test effect of different i(Q)_1 equations?

the 4pi**2 bit is still confusing, discuss FT and mathematical reasons for scaling the data etc.

+ how does this affect the -4pirhor bit used, having to scale this as well!!!
> that's bad!	


Bugs:

Crash when delete contents of density input - check other fields as well
FIXED > issue with QDoubleValidator allowing intermediate fields >> e.g. '.', ' '

but similar crash on converting float in rmin


try on



Crash when click autoscale bkg - after load data, uncheck bkg >> then check again but no load
when check this box should blank buttons if no data loaded




shit shouldn't you be only taking the first half of this array???


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Add option to add mod function when one hasn;t been used in the final tab
Check solver options working? + look at adding global min finder?
check crash when keep clicking refine?
