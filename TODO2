Thins to add:



Option in optim_ui to use different solver

	nelder-mead simplex probably best one?
	> have an options menu with a dialog to set these things?


Option in optim_ui to set more options of smoothing function
	> add to another tab in extended options dialog 


Are there any other options for the cosine-window algorithm etc. to add?


In results UI save output > also add S_inf info for AL only, if statement to check method

In extended options dialog should be option to change log style
> + explanation of what this is


Then README file

--- should make it rich text so can see equations???

- structure of package etc. where all the files are
reference list - including for included data!!! - ask james where this from


Then use of core program

>> code example of how to set parameters, etc.


Then walkthrough of actual gui, subtracting backgrounds, etc. etc.

--------

in core:

test negative DELTA F(r) causes

test effect of different i(Q)_1 equations?

the 4pi**2 bit is still confusing, discuss FT and mathematical reasons for scaling the data etc.

+ how does this affect the -4pirhor bit used, having to scale this as well!!!
> that's bad!	


Bugs:

Crash when delete contents of density input - check other fields as well

When dataset too large it crashes - in fourier transform N < dataset so tries to add negative number
of padding zeros to the array

Should there be options to change this padding? - doesn't it affect resolution?
