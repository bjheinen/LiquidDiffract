Add error handling messages - e.g. warning message when trying to load bad data etc. > Fixed
Fix polyatomic case ? needs testing
Fix d_pq stuff etc. > should it be taken out of the code???
Add options to change solver, change log mode 
Options to change smoothing settings?
Write README
Include refs
Fix docs/comments
Fix API frontend
Use multiprocessing to speed up calculation of i(q) etc. >>> this will help
speed up the refinement


About page?
Config/additional options dialog

with tabs???

Options:


Log mode
Data smoothing options
Solver options


Here is a raw data file "CaAl2O4_2000_raw.dat" for liquid CaAl2O4 at 2000 degC and a normalised S(Q) "CA_2000_SQ.dat".


I also attach simulated S(Q) functions generated from A-L and F-Z formulisms. You'll notice the experimental and simulated S(Q) are not perfect at low-Q, but they should be closer to agreement at mid to higher Q-values.


The density of liquid CaAl2O4 is about 0.0734 A**-3.


I hope that helps?
