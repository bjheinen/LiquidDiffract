Fix API/using without gui

Add functionality for other solvers (L-BFGS-B & SLSQP working so far)
Use multiprocessing to speed up calculations
Code efficiency - combine warning message boxes with inherited class (in gui.utility)
Install script for release?
Remove references to d_pq in core.core? > or add functionality

Are there any other options for the cosine-window algorithm etc. to add?




When dataset too large it crashes - in fourier transform N < dataset so tries to add negative number
of padding zeros to the array

Should there be options to change this padding? - doesn't it affect resolution?

Causes of problems:
(possible places)



fft scaling (e.g. in calc_F_r) > currently multiplying by 4*np.pi**2 ? 
(check Keen)




unikely to be in calc_structure_factor > more likely one of the smaller functions it calls:

calc_coherent_scattering > *=N?

Z_tot?

K_p or one of the averages probably
